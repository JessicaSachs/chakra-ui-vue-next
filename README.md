#### Contributors' note:
Hi!

I'm excited to finally get this project out in the open. I love working on Chakra! Of recent, between my startup(mid-pivot), school, ministry, and family, I have a limited amount of time every day, so I may not be very active online on Twitter/Discord/Github to respond to issues very actively. The reason for this is that I find that I'm most productive when I have less presence on social media(I need it to deliver my best work <3). Notwithstanding, I indeed am oft pleasantly surprised when I do see the help and support from the community and different contributors! Thank you!

I have the entire Chakra UI core team members and Vue community to thank for their support, and for every contributor who does so by opening issues, writing tests and fixing bugs. I'm generally reachable by email at `excellence@jbakebwa.dev` or on `@codebender828` on Twitter and on the Chakra UI Discord.

For now I'll be hacking away at these projects! Blessings!
